# indigov take home

Problem:
> Indigov is a constituent management system that allows elected officials to manage their constituency.
A newly elected official is planning on holding a town hall meeting and is setting up a digital tablet to
collect contact information from constituents that would like to sign up to the officialâ€™s newsletter on a
tablet at the door. The email addresses, names, and address information about the constituents would
be submitted to Indigov for storage. The official already has about 500 constituents in their database,
and it is very important to them that any duplicates are merged during the contact gathering process.

## Running the application
